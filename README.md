# Applied_Data_Science_Statistics-Trends
## Introduction
The dataset used in this analysis is based on player statistics from the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024, showcasing significant indicators for both batsmen and bowlers throughout numerous matches. This report uses visualizations—a scatter plot, bar chart, and heatmap—to investigate relationships between these variables, presenting a statistical summary of noteworthy performances and patterns across the tournament.
## Analysis and Graphs
Scatter Plot (Relational Graph)
- Purpose: This scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between batting average and strike rate, aiming to identify if players with higher averages also achieve higher strike rates.

Bar Chart (Categorical Graph)
- Purpose: This bar chart compares bowlers by their total wickets taken during the tournament, allowing for a categorical assessment of performance.

Heatmap (Statistical Graph)
- Purpose: This heatmap visualizes the correlations among various bowling performance metrics, including overs, balls, wickets, economy rate, and runs conceded, providing a comprehensive view of inter-metric relationships.

## Conclusion
This report identifies important trends in player performance at the T20 World Cup 2024. Batsmen with higher strike rates often have higher averages, as seen by the strong positive link between these metrics. On the bowling side, high wicket-takers frequently had poorer economy rates, a pattern confirmed by the negative association found between wickets and economy. These findings highlight the importance of balancing consistency with scoring or defensive efficiency in Twenty20 cricket. The offered visualizations serve to illuminate these tendencies by providing a data-driven view on the attributes of good batting and bowling performances in the event.
